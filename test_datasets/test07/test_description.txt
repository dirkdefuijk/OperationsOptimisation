* Test VIP constraints and obj function
- 3 gates, 3 flights
- category varies
- number of passengers per flight varies
- distance per gate varies
- time slot fixed
- VIPs on one flight

* Expected Result
- Feasible
- VIP flight can only be assigned to gate with d < 30 m. flight 1 needs to go to gate 1
- Z = (100*100 + 5*29 + 300*31)/10000 = 1.9445 = 19.445 km
